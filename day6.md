# Day 06
## Introduction 
Topic of the sixth day is "Pixels". 

## Concept
I wanted to create some sort of bug like in this (example)[wwww]. However, I had no prior experience in pixel manipulation, except for some knowledge gained from using Photoshop. With a rough idea of what might be technically possible, I documented my progress through this photo series:

To start, I loaded an image of a cup. I chose an image with a white background, thinking it would be easier to filter out the empty pixels. From this point on, I began working with the pixels by loading them onto my canvas and experimenting with manipulation. 

#### The image

#### Changing grid size and pixels based on the their value

#### Adding pixels
At this stage, I added squares with different colors and coordinates, closely resembling the idea of a gradient.

#### Testing with 3d 
I conducted tests using OrbitControls to explore what would happen when I offset, copy, and transform pixels in the Z-axis.

#### Pixel Shifting
Subsequently, I aimed to create an image that works with grayscale depth, with pixels representing the average of RGB values as positions in 3D space.
