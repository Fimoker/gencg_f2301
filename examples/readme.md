This directory hosts all the examples / starter code for the classes. New examples will be added regularly so you might have to pull it or sync it later on... 

If you like to modify some of the examples it is recommended for each student to copy the files into your own class repository and do the changes there. Copy and paste `sketch.js` there

```
