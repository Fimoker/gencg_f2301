## Intro

Welcome to the classes generative design @ HSLU / Digital Ideation. This is the main page for the class, you will find a list of resources available below as well as some other information to help with this 3 weeks workshop. It is advised to download / clone this repo at the beginning of the class and eventually keep it updated. All assignments / exercises should be done by students in their own private classroom repo.

## WEEK 01

For this first week we will focus on the basis. We will be looking at the core functions of p5.js, and some simple useful maths technics. We will also experiment with shapes, patterns and agents (intelligent and non intelligent). We will then learn how color spaces are created and how to generate them dynamically.

- [Notes part 01: Setup, Basis, Shapes, Patterns, Agents][refNotes01]
- [Notes part 02: Colors][refNotes02]

## WEEK 02

During the second week ot the workshop we will adapt what we've learned so far to new concepts. We will learn how to manipulate images, create generative typography and play with oscillation & symmetry. We will also start experimenting with live server interaction and websockets.

- [Notes part 04: ][refNotes04]

## WEEK 03

The last week of the workshop is dedicated to the "open assignment". You will have to pick one of the themes we will discuss back in week 01 (cadaver / logo / sound sculpture ) and create your own implementation of it. Feel free to work in group or on your own for this assignment.


## Notes

Evaluation criteria are:
- Quality of the result
- Legibility and reusability of the code

There will be small exercises throughout each days, one weekly assignment and a main project covering the 3 weeks classes.
